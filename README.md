# FDRA_FODR_FOD

Tool that automates the acquisition of wildfire occurrence data, and preps it for use in Fire Family Plus.

### How does it work?

The tool provides users with the ability to acquire [InFORM Fire Occurrence Data Records (FODR)](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::inform-fire-occurrence-data-records/about) data and the [Fire Program Analysis Fire-Occurrence Database](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2013-0009.6). Once acquired, the tool will merge these datasets into a consistent FODR-based schema, and intersect with a user provided Fire Danger Rating Area (FDRA) boundary dataset.
